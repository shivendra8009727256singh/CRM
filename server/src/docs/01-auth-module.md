## 16. Important Notes

- There is no public registration endpoint.
- User creation is controlled by admin.
- HR and Support login accounts are created by admin.
- Employee login accounts are also created by admin for now.
- Later, HR can be allowed to create Employee users if required.
- Refresh tokens are stored only as hashes.
- Passwords are never returned in API responses.
- Sensitive token fields are hidden using `select: false`.
- `toSafeObject()` removes sensitive fields before sending response.
